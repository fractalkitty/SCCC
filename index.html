		<p>
			At Salem Creative Coding Club, we explore the intersection of art and technology. Through coding, we create interactive digital experiences, generative artwork, and unique creative projects. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just curious about coding, this is a space to experiment, collaborate, and express your creativity through code.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Our focus is on using coding languages such as JavaScript, Python, p5.js, Processing, and others to build visually stunning and conceptually interesting projects. It's all about pushing boundaries, learning, and having fun with code!
